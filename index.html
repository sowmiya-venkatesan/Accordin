      <button class="accordion">Q2. How does campus recruitment work?</button>

          <p>Conventional campus recruitment works in a way where organizations are required to form a team that visits multiple campuses to select best-in-class talent. A list of campuses to visit is created, the team makes arrangements for travel and accommodation, and conducts exams and interviews at different venues. Organizations are now moving toward a virtual campus recruitment strategy that employs modern-age tools for a time and cost-efficient process.
